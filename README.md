## About this project?

This project is about ordering online food from your local restaurants. Anybody can create an account and order online. 
Food Ordering Website project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. HTML structured the pages, while CSS provided a clean, responsive design with smooth animations. JavaScript handled interactive features like real-time cart updates, menu filtering, and form validation. PHP served as the backend engine, managing user authentication, order processing, and secure communication with the MySQL database. I optimized SQL queries for faster data retrieval and ensured seamless data flow between frontend and backend. Key features included user authentication, a structured food catalogue, interactive search and filtering, payment gateway and a smooth checkout flow.
